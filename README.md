# City-Firewood-Project
Worked as Data Analytics Consultant, independently  responsible for the City Firewood company project in ETL process and data reporting. In this project, 
* Created a data pipeline to scrape data from the council website.
* Used Python and Alteryx to execute ELT process including extracing data from various data source both internal and external, transforming and cleaning data, loading data to data warehouse (snowflake). Cleaned more than 100,000 customer information data from the City Firewood company database especially the customer addresses data and match the customer addresses with the LINZ addresses and Postal addresses.
* Generated analysing report by Tableau including Customer Churn Analysis, Potential Market Analysis, Market Share Analysis and Sales Analysis.

According to the confidentiality requirements, I cannot upload the complete project to the Github. I only uploaded 2 videos that show the Tableau dashboards function and appearence.
